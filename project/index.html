            <p>
                Hi! I'm so glad you came to visit for a bit. I'd like to share something with you, an amazing gift that
                is
                available to everyone! It is called the Plan of Salvation. It was prepared even before the creation of
                the
                world, for the potential benefit of every single person.
                <br>
                Let's start with some simple questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What comes after this life?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would you like to be with your loved ones again at that time?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do those that have suffered so much deserve so much more than they had in life?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you have wondered things like that, then hopefully this Plan will bring hope to you.
            </p>

            <h2>
                "Okay, that sounds interesting. But why should I care about this? It sounds like just another hopeful
                afterlife."
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hey, I get it. There are a LOT of ideas out there about what might be the truth. If you would like to
                learn
                some more about why you might want to learn more, I share more details about the Plan of Salvation and
                how
                it rewards everyone on the page linked below:
            </p>
            <a href="rewards.html">Reward Descriptions</a> (Okay, maybe that sounds like a sweestakes, but please take a
            look anyways!)

            <h2>
                "So, what do I need to do?"
            </h2>
            <p>
                Good question! And the simple answer is "just listen to God and follow His guidance". However, since a
                critical part of the plan is to be able to choose for yourself He requires us to learn and teach each
                other.
                No person can obtain the greatest rewards offered on their own, and that is very intentional. Godhood is
                not
                suitable for the selfish and greedy. (Really, that would be a terrifying prospect! There are plenty of
                fantasy stories about evil god-like entities, I don't think anybody actually wants that to be real.
                People that make harmful choices are enough of a challenge.) So, here is a page where I
                share some of the requirements that are in place to attain the highest rewards, as we understand them.
                <br>
                Although it can feel confounding, the Plan has a fair amount of intentional vagueness in some regards
                because real choices require a real chance of choosing differently. If you had all the answers and it
                was
                completely clearly laid out, what person would choose against it? Paradoxical as it may sound, it isn't
                the
                desire for anyone to choose against the Plan and fail. Rather, it is the desire and hope that each
                person
                will choose it despite other options.
            </p>

                As I said, this is just a simple introduction to a selection of our beliefs. I hope that I may have
                answered some
                questions and opened up some new ones. If you would like to learn more, the most effective way would be
                to get in contact with the missionaries. You can do so yourself by visiting <a
                    href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/contact-us">here to request meeting the
                    missionaries</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, I'd appreciate any thoughts, questions, whatever. If you have anything you wish to share, go ahead
                and send it on!
