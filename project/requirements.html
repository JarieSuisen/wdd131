                So, what do you have to do? Well, it's not so much a checklist or "have to do" kind of thing. It's a bit
                more like general requirements for a reward. If you meet the requirements, you get the reward. The
                tricky
                part is that if you can't just do it for yourself because the requirements include serving and helping
                others out of genuine love for them.
                <br>
                On the other hand, they are all technically easy to do! The hardest part often is in the act of choosing
                to
                follow them rather than something else that may seem more fun or rewarding in the short term.
            </p>

            <ul>Now, these items are <b>not</b> all-inclusive. Remember, choice is a critical part of the Plan and that
                includes
                what we do and how we do it and who for... etcetera. So I'm just mentioning some of the broad types so
                you
                can get a feel for them. There is a lot of in-depth details to learn, but I would just be repeating what
                others have said (and they say it better than I could).
                <li>
                    <b>Love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.</b> There are many ways to show your love! However, there
                    are
                    some
                    ways that show it more than others. It sounds critical, but words are cheap and although Heavenly
                    Father
                    absolutely does enjoy hearing from you (after all, he is your Father! He may know everything, but
                    hearing from you remains something special.) what they want is to see your honest actions. This
                    quote
                    may sound familiar, from the book of Matthew (25:40) "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
                    least
                    of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." What you do for others' benefit is rewarded as if
                    you
                    had done it for Jesus.
                    <br>
                    Though, beware the other side of the coin: What you do against others, or choose not to do despite
                    their
                    need, may well count against you. I am not the judge, He is. And He will know whether you did or
                    didn't
                    do something out of love, spite, ignorance, or any other positive or negative reason.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Love others.</b> If this sounds like a repetition, that's because it ties directly into the prior
                    note! You
                    can do things to help people for any reason, but it can often be boiled down to two points: Was it
                    selfless, where you are helping someone for their sake, or selfish, where you are doing something
                    for a
                    reward or merely requirement or they may simply be the fortunate receivers of something you did that
                    did
                    not have them in mind. Things like that. It's really all about intent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Keep god's commandments.</b> This one may also sound redundant, but that actually shows how
                    important
                    it is.
                    The Plan doesn't have a simple checklist of rules. Instead there are guidelines to help you make the
                    better choices. Very few commandments are explicitly direct, usually in the form of "ABSOLUTELY DO
                    NOT
                    TO THIS THING BECAUSE IT IS WRONG AND YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT, SO DON'T DO IT."
                    <br>
                    Like, here are a couple of the easy ones to remember: "Don't kill" and "Don't steal". I can't say
                    for sure, but I think ones like these are called out both because they are so explicitly bad and
                    maybe
                    because they are so obvious that pointing them out out won't affect a person's power to make a
                    choice,
                    it's more of an easy reminder at that point.
                    <br>
                    Another way to put it comes straight from scripture: "If ye love me, keep my commandments." (John
                    14:15)
                    Or, keeping the commandments proves to Him your love. You might not have much respect for a person
                    that
                    says "I care about you" but then breaks their word, would you? It's kinda like that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Repent and mend your ways when you do mess up.</b> Despite how hard Satan works to paint things
                    differently, Jesus truly wants to help you to fix your mistakes and improve. He already paid the
                    price
                    for every sin of every person throughout all time. That includes you, and He knows and loves you.
                    But,
                    He does not give a free lunch when it comes to sin and requires you repay Him by first doing what
                    you
                    can to make things right and to always work at becoming a better person. That's right, his cost for
                    helping you is for you to become better. Seriously, I can't think of a more "win-win" situation than
                    that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Work to become like Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father.</b> That's right, you weren't put here for
                    entertainment. You are a child with godly potential, and Heavenly Father wants more than anything
                    for
                    you to grow up to become worthy of sharing in His glory, power, and responsibilities. That's right,
                    He
                    wants you to join Him in the family business! (Sure, the details are, again, vague, but the other
                    rewards alone are easily worth it.) The thing is, the power He wields is not meant for idle purposes
                    and
                    cannot be entrusted to those that will abuse it. He was once like you; He lived a mortal life and
                    suffered through trials of youth, growing, learning, sharing, and any challenges that came along as
                    He
                    worked to become like His Father. The details are not provided to us (really, that's not our
                    business
                    either, just like my diary entries are not your business), but the point is that "As man now is, God
                    once was. As God now is, [each child of God] may be." That is a quote from Lorenzo Snow, and
                    something I
                    love. It is proof that families on Earth are based on the spirit family we have always been part of.
