            When it comes to the Plan of Salvation, it is true that selflessness is a central part of it. But Heavenly
            Father wants you to also know what you will get out of it anyways! Knowing that what you are doing helps
            others AND helps you as well should give twice the reason to do so in joy.
        </p>

        <ul>Now, the first part to note is that there is a big difference between the commonly-perceived "Heaven vs Hell
            afterlife". Instead, we understand that we are all destined for greatness. It is not a case of "well, you
            failed so it sucks to be you for eternity", but more like "Welcome home, my child. You have proven yourself
            worthy of a reward, so let us see how you did."
            <li>
                <b>A Kingdom of Glory.</b> That's right! If you came to live in mortality at all, you earn a place in a
                kingdom of glory. There are three of them, which we refer to as the Telestial Kingdom, Terrestrial
                Kingdom, and the Celestial Kingdom. They rank in that order, with the Telestial Kingdom being <b>more
                    amazing and wonderful than any mortal mind can imagine</b>, the Terrestrial Kingdom being greater
                than the Telestial, and the Celestial Kingdom is the domain of godliness with Heavenly Father Himself.
                Seriously, if it isn't possible to comprehend the Telestial, then the greatest of all is ... Yeah,
                there's not really words for beyond the extreme of understanding. But it is definitely worth it to be
                with our parents and loved ones again, and that's all I need to know to want it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Eternal unity with your family.</b> Those that attain the Celestial Kingdom are able to have their
                familial bonds from mortal life kept permenantly bound for eternity. Sadly, there are those that will
                not choose to accept the Celestial Kingdom and, as far as I understand, will be exempt from that unity.
                As to what that <b>means</b> in the eternal perspective... I'm not totally sure. But I know the family I
                have now and the family I hope to one day have are absolutely worth it. I pray that you have others that
                you feel the same level of connection with and will look forward to rejoining.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>No more tummyaches!</b> Ok, more like a perfect body that cannot suffer any problems ever again. You
                will be reunited with your body, with it remade in your most perfect and beautiful state and of such an
                existence that it is immortal and immune to harm. (As to the exact specifics, I can only assume it is
                even greater than any fantasy story might depict it.) As it has been beautifully described, "The soul
                shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored
                to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their
                proper and perfect frame." (Alma 40:23) I, for one, very much look forward to having my hair back! (And
                hopefully no facial hair for me. Not my style, and it is itchy.)
                <br>
                <em>Also, there is something special with this one:</em> If you came into mortal life at all, you
                automatically
                gain this reward. It is a guarantee, regardless of any other possible outcome. Gaining a material body
                was reason enough to be worth the challenges of mortality and no matter what path you take you will get
                it back for the eternities. This is a major reason why Satan and his followers hate you, me, and
                everyone else so greatly and wish for us to suffer. They cannot ever gain a body, having chosen instead
                to oppose the Plan from the beginning. As such, they are doing all they can to ensure you lose out on as
                much as possible in revenge with the hope for you to suffer much like them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Eternal growth.</b> All that you learn in life will be carried with you. Sure, that's not a lot
                compared to the eternity that lies ahead, but anything you have is that much of a head start. It's not
                clear just to what purposes our knowledge will be, other than helping design and build worlds (which
                sounds pretty epic to me!), but learning and growing has always been a core teaching so it must be worth
                it. And in the eternities there is... eternal amounts of time (I assume) during which you can learn and
                master anything! Again, this one can feel a bit difficult to hype up because of common views like
                "learning is hard" or "learning takes so much time". But I also know that if eternity were boring then
                our Heavenly Father would not be so excited about it. So let's trust Him and make sure we get to find
                out what that is all about!
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Not suffering Eternal Darkness.</b> Ok, so, this is not so much a "reward" as a commentary on the
                single "bad end" that a person can attain instead of a Kingdom of Glory. However, it is reserved for
                only a very few that truly attain Celestial Kingdom worthiness and <b>then</b> willingly turned to
                completely oppose Heavenly Father, as Satan and his followers did in premortal life. (ie: <b>This is
                    worse than the fate for "liers, thieves, murderers" and all other terrible acts</b>, because even
                they will attain the Telestial Kingdom) As such, this is
                not something that can be suffered due to ignorance or accident. There is no reason to worry about
                falling to Eternal Darkness because there literally cannot be any good reason to do so. And I believe
                that the very fact that you are intersted in the truth is proof enough that you will never be at risk of
                that path. Also, it is a depressing topic (and rather off-topic, sorry), so lets stop there.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Hopefully you now have some understanding of what you have to benefit as you follow the Plan of Salvation! I
            don't pretend to be good at explaining these things, and the church has missionaries in all parts of the
            world to help explain it so much better than I can. If you are interested, please visit <a
                href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/contact-us">here to contact them</a>. Even if
            we never meet, (though who can say, with all eternity ahead!) I pray that you will choose to rejoin your
            family in eternal happiness.
        </p>
